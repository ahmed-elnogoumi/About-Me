            <p>
                I'm a full-stack Software Development Engineer with a military background in IT Systems Administration.
                Originally from Hawaii where I grew up and met my wife of 13 years. We have a beautiful 4 year old daughter
                and three wonderful dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience in Software Development extends from the completion of Code Fellows Code-102 course and my continuing 
                education in Code-201 currently and in the future through Code-301 and Code-401. 
            </p>
            <P>
                I aspire to work for a great company that shares the same values of growth through positivity and growth
                mindset, while allowing the ability to have great working hours, benefits, bonuses and competitive pay.
            </P>
